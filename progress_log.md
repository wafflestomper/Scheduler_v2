## 2023-03-16 - Summary of Completed Work (2023-03-16 12:00)

We've built a Django-based school scheduling application with the following features:

- Added validation for imported data to ensure integrity
- Created a user-friendly upload interface with file format guidance

### Scheduling Algorithm
- Developed a constraint-based algorithm that:
  - Creates sections for core courses by grade level
  - Assigns students to appropriate grade-level core classes
  - Creates sections for elective courses
  - Assigns students to electives based on their preferences
  - Handles scheduling constraints (teacher availability, room capacity)

### User Interface

  - CSV upload interface with format instructions
  - Master schedule view with conflict detection
  - Student schedule view with filtering options
  - Section editing capability for manual adjustments

### Export Functionality

## 2023-03-17 - CSV Format Updates

- Updated CSV import format options for all entity types:
  - **Teachers**: Added first_name, last_name, grade_level (optional), and gender (optional) fields
  - **Students**: Changed to first_name, nickname (optional), last_name, grade_level format
  - **Periods**: Simplified to period_id, start_time, end_time format
  - **Courses**: Updated to course_id, name, teachers (optional), grade_level, duration, sections_needed (optional)
  - **Sections**: Added new CSV import option for sections with course_id, section_number, teacher, period, room, max_size
- Enhanced the CSV upload interface with:
  - Downloadable templates for all entity types
  - Detailed examples with proper data formatting
  - Interactive accordion-style documentation
  - Clear guidance on required and optional fields
- Updated database model for Section to support custom section IDs

## 2023-03-18 - CSV Upload Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite for CSV upload functionality:
  - Added test data files for all entity types (students, teachers, rooms, courses, periods, sections)
  - Implemented test cases to verify successful upload of each entity type
  - Added validation tests to ensure proper error handling for invalid CSV formats
  - Fixed issues with time format handling in period uploads
  - Ensured proper section ID generation and validation
- Enhanced the student name formatting to include nicknames in quotes when available
- Verified that all CSV upload functionality works correctly with the new formats

## 2025-03-15 15:55 - Fixed View Students Feature

Fixed issues with the view students feature:
1. Added the missing `{% load schedule_extras %}` tag to the view_students.html template to load the custom template filter
2. Added 'rest_framework' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
3. Installed Django REST Framework with pip

The view students feature is now working correctly, allowing filtering by grade level and search by name.

## 2025-03-16 12:30 - Implemented Student Detail View and Admin Reports

Enhanced the student management capabilities with the following features:

1. **Student Detail View**:
   - Created a detailed view for individual student information
   - Added student personal data display
   - Implemented schedule display for the student
   - Added navigation breadcrumbs for improved user experience

2. **Student Management**:
   - Implemented edit functionality for student records
   - Added delete capability with confirmation page
   - Created proper form validation for student data

3. **Administrative Reports**:
   - Added a comprehensive reporting dashboard
   - Implemented enrollment statistics by grade level
   - Created course enrollment reporting with class size analytics
   - Added teacher workload reporting
   - Integrated data visualization charts using Chart.js
   - Added sortable tables with DataTables

4. **UI Improvements**:
   - Enhanced navigation with reports link
   - Improved student listing with direct links to student details
   - Added consistent breadcrumb navigation throughout the application
