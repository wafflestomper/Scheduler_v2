## 2023-03-16 - Summary of Completed Work (2023-03-16 12:00)

We've built a Django-based school scheduling application with the following features:

### Data Model
- Created models for Teachers, Rooms, Students, Courses, Periods, and Sections with appropriate relationships between them
- Implemented proper validation and helper methods for accessing and manipulating data

### CSV Import System
- Implemented functionality to bulk-upload data via CSV files for all entity types
- Added validation for imported data to ensure integrity
- Created a user-friendly upload interface with file format guidance

### Scheduling Algorithm
- Developed a constraint-based algorithm that:
  - Creates sections for core courses by grade level
  - Assigns students to appropriate grade-level core classes
  - Creates sections for elective courses
  - Assigns students to electives based on their preferences
  - Handles scheduling constraints (teacher availability, room capacity)

### User Interface
- Built a responsive Bootstrap-based UI with:
  - CSV upload interface with format instructions
  - Master schedule view with conflict detection
  - Student schedule view with filtering options
  - Section editing capability for manual adjustments

### Export Functionality
- Added CSV export for both master and student schedules
- Implemented proper formatting for exported schedules

### Version Control
- Set up Git repository with a full commit history
- Pushed to GitHub at https://github.com/wafflestomper/Scheduler_v2.git
- Created a progress log to document all development milestones

## 2023-03-17 - CSV Format Updates

- Updated CSV import format options for all entity types:
  - **Teachers**: Added first_name, last_name, grade_level (optional), and gender (optional) fields
  - **Students**: Changed to first_name, nickname (optional), last_name, grade_level format
  - **Periods**: Simplified to period_id, start_time, end_time format
  - **Courses**: Updated to course_id, name, teachers (optional), grade_level, duration, sections_needed (optional)
  - **Sections**: Added new CSV import option for sections with course_id, section_number, teacher, period, room, max_size
- Enhanced the CSV upload interface with:
  - Downloadable templates for all entity types
  - Detailed examples with proper data formatting
  - Interactive accordion-style documentation
  - Clear guidance on required and optional fields
- Updated database model for Section to support custom section IDs

## 2023-03-18 - CSV Upload Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite for CSV upload functionality:
  - Added test data files for all entity types (students, teachers, rooms, courses, periods, sections)
  - Implemented test cases to verify successful upload of each entity type
  - Added validation tests to ensure proper error handling for invalid CSV formats
  - Fixed issues with time format handling in period uploads
  - Ensured proper section ID generation and validation
- Enhanced the student name formatting to include nicknames in quotes when available
- Verified that all CSV upload functionality works correctly with the new formats

## Next Steps

### Testing
- Test CSV import with the sample data files
- Verify the scheduling algorithm works correctly with real-world constraints
- Identify and fix any bugs in the scheduling logic
- Add proper unit tests for core functionality

### UI Enhancements
- Add more detailed validation feedback for CSV uploads
- Improve conflict resolution interface
- Add visual indicators for periods without assignments
- Implement drag-and-drop interface for schedule adjustments

### Algorithm Improvements
- Enhance scheduling constraints for better class balance
- Add teacher preference considerations
- Optimize room assignments based on capacity and class size
- Implement student load balancing across sections

### Documentation
- Create user documentation for school administrators
- Add inline code documentation for future maintenance
- Document the CSV format requirements in more detail
- Add setup instructions for new deployments

### Deployment Preparation
- Configure PostgreSQL for production use
- Set up proper environment variables
- Add user authentication for admin functions
- Create a deployment guide
