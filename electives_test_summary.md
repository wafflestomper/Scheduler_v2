# 6th Grade Trimester Course System - Test Results Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the test results for the 6th grade trimester course system implementation. The system allows for scheduling 6th grade students into three groups of trimester courses (WH6/HW6, CTA6/TAC6, and WW6/Art6/Mus6) while ensuring each student:
- Takes one course from each group
- Takes each course in a different trimester
- Takes all courses in the same period
- Follows section size constraints

## Test Results

### 1. Database Model Tests
✅ **PASSED**: The `TrimesterCourseGroup` model is correctly implemented and contains all required fields and relationships.
- Groups correctly configured for World History, Computer Technology, and Arts Electives
- Proper relationship with Course model established
- Group types and other attributes properly defined

### 2. Utility Function Tests
✅ **PASSED**: The utility functions for managing trimester courses are correctly implemented:
- `assign_trimester_courses`: Successfully assigns students to courses following all constraints
- `get_trimester_course_conflicts`: Correctly identifies scheduling conflicts
- `balance_trimester_course_sections`: Properly balances section enrollments

### 3. Assignment Algorithm Tests
✅ **PASSED**: The assignment algorithm correctly handles:
- Course assignments across different trimesters
- Consistent period assignments
- Section capacity constraints
- Multiple groups of courses with different numbers of options

### 4. Conflict Detection Tests
✅ **PASSED**: The conflict detection system correctly identifies:
- Multiple courses in the same trimester
- Courses in different periods
- Missing required group assignments

### 5. Core Requirements Verification
✅ **PASSED**: All core requirements have been met:
- Required course groups exist in the database
- All needed courses are present
- Assignment functionality works correctly

## Conclusion
The 6th grade trimester course system is fully implemented and tested. It meets all the requirements and is ready for use in the scheduling system.
