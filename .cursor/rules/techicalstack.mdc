# Technical stack 
- Python for the backend
- html/js or react for the frontend
- SQL databases, never JSON file storage
- Separate databases for dev, test, and prod
- Elasticsearch for search, using elastic.co hosting
- Elastic.co will have dev and prod indexes
- Python tests

#Additional info
- After pushing to github, summarize the work that has been done and append it to file "progress_log.md" in the Scheduler_v2 directory.  Append below older material but above ## Next Steps. Include time stamp to appends.  Also provide a separate summary as well as next steps for me to seed a new chat with what we have compeleted and what our next steps are so that the new chat can be informed.
-When I start a new chat, recommend starting a new branch and what feature we will be workign on.

IMPORTANT: Each time I ask to git push or git merge, look over the sizes of ALL the files.  If any of the files are over 300 lines of code, tell me what the files are and ask me if we should look at refactoring.
