# Technical stack 
- Python for the backend
- html/js or react for the frontend
- SQL databases, never JSON file storage
- Separate databases for dev, test, and prod
- Elasticsearch for search, using elastic.co hosting
- Elastic.co will have dev and prod indexes
- Python tests

#Additional info
- After pushing to github, summarize the work that has been done and append it to file "progress_log.md" in the Scheduler_v2 directory.  Append below older material but above ## Next Steps. Include time stamp to appends.  Also provide a separate summary as well as next steps for me to seed a new chat with what we have compeleted and what our next steps are so that the new chat can be informed.
-When I start a new chat, recommend starting a new branch and what feature we will be workign on.

IMPORTANT: Avoid having files over 300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.  Do low risk refactoring.
